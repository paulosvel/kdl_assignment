# User Management React Application

This is a React application for managing users using a mock API. It allows you to view a list of users, add new users, update existing users, and delete users.
Additionally, it provides features such as client-side form validation, search and filter functionality, and more.

# Features

View Users: Browse a list of users with columns for Name, Email, and Company Name in a tabular format.

Add User: Click on the "Add User" button to open a form modal for data entry. Ensure you fill in all required fields, and client-side form validation will prevent
incomplete or invalid data submission.

Update User: To update an existing user, click the "Edit" button next to the user's information. You can modify the Name, Email, and Company Name fields.

Delete User: When deleting a user, you'll be prompted for confirmation to ensure you don't accidentally delete a user.

Search and Filter: Use the search and filter functionality to find specific users or filter users by criteria such as company name.

Pagination: If the user list is long, pagination is provided to handle a large number of users effectively.

Loading: Loading indicator when opening the app.
